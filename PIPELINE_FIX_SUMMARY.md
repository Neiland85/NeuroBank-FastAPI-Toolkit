# 🚀 Pipeline Fix Summary - NeuroBank FastAPI Railway Deployment

## 🎯 Issue Resolved: Docker Build + Trivy Scan Failure

### ❌ **Original Problem**
```
FATAL	Fatal error	run error: image scan error: scan error: unable to initialize a scan service: unable to initialize an image scan service: unable to find the specified image "neurobank-fastapi:test"
Process completed with exit code 1.
```

**Root Cause**: Docker image was built but not loaded into the local Docker daemon, making it unavailable for Trivy security scanning.

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented** (Commit: 7033ce5)

### 🔧 **Docker Build Action Fix**
```yaml
- name: 🏗️ Build Docker Image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    push: false
    load: true              # ← CRITICAL FIX: Load image locally
    tags: neurobank-fastapi:test
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

### 🔍 **Enhanced Verification**
```yaml
- name: 🔍 Verify Docker Image
  run: |
    echo "Verifying Docker image was built successfully..."
    docker images neurobank-fastapi:test
    docker inspect neurobank-fastapi:test
```

### ⚡ **Optimized Trivy Scan**
```yaml
- name: 🔍 Run Trivy Container Scan
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: neurobank-fastapi:test
    format: 'sarif'
    output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
    scan-type: 'image'
    ignore-unfixed: true           # Skip unfixed vulnerabilities
    vuln-type: 'os,library'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'      # Focus on critical issues only
```

### 🛡️ **Conditional Upload**
```yaml
- name: 📤 Upload Trivy Scan Results
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
  if: always()                     # Upload even if scan finds issues
  with:
    sarif_file: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```
